A, K, Q, J, T, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2

five of a kind     five   7   hash len = 1
four of a kind     four   6   hash len = 2, 1\*4, 1*1
full house         full   5   hash len = 2, 1\*3, 1*2

two pair           two    3   hash len = 3, 2\*2, 1*1
one pair           one    2   hash len = 4
high card          zero   1   hash len = 5

then by highest first card
